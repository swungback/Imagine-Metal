# Imagine Metal: handoff (2026-11-05)

Where things stand, for picking the work up in a new conversation.

## Setup
- Repo: swungback/Imagine-Metal. Push to main → CI (.github/workflows/build.yml) compiles every Metal shader, builds the jar,
  publishes the "dev" release.
- Deploy: download `releases/download/dev/imagine-metal-0.1.0.jar?t=<time>` into
  `~/Documents/instances/Imagine metal/minecraft/mods`, check a marker string with `unzip -p`, then replace the jar.
- Jack's settings: `config/imaginemetal.properties` in that instance. Screenshots and `logs/latest.log` there too. His notes
  are chat lines in the log (`[CHAT] <herningstang> ...`) just before each screenshot.
- Reversed-Z depth everywhere (0 = far / sky). ImFrame is 928 bytes (lighting.metal, ImagineFrame.SIZE, mcown.m imFrame[928]).

## Fixed today (in the current jar, not yet confirmed in game)
- Water depth mode: the under-water copy was never taken (imssr.m skipped it while a pass was open). Now copies; thickness from
  depth ratio; absorption and murk by the biome colour.
- Nether wobble (underwater waver ran on the Nether's fog mode). Every biome's own daylight (Haze.look).
- IterationT End ported 1:1 (sky.metal it* functions, IT_NOISE = its noise.png), light (0.856, 0.276, 0.436), eclipse cycle.
- Light fog: trilinear reads of the light grid, strength 0.016 at a^4. Contact shadows: fixed 0.5 dither, stricter threshold.
- Outline patch no longer compiles lighting.metal in (it had stopped drawing). End portal surface back to vanilla's.
- Stems' glow halved; caves' floor light doubled; slight vibrance in imGrade.

## Open (from Jack's 15:18-15:43 screenshots)
1. Nether portal invisible (15.23.34): the portal quads don't show at all; particles do. Was fine a few builds ago. Suspects:
   own_fs_tr changes, the under copy ending the pass, or the portal not hitting the translucent path in 26.3. Needs a check
   with portals on/off and waterFx on/off.
2. Water with "Water refraction and foam" on still looks wrong (no labelled screenshot yet). Check the capture actually runs
   (log a line once from Reflections.captureUnder), and that thickness isn't ~0 (foam everywhere).
3. Seabed seen from above (waterFx off): dark straight-edged patches (15.39.28) and bright wavy lines (the water texture?).
4. Stained glass on grass (15.37.39-51): tinted patch fine; a stale grey patch stays after the glass is removed (glass seeds
   in LightVolume not cleared on block change?).
5. Mobs: dark in caves, flat; want normals and light from farther lights. Dropped light items should light (dynamic light).
6. Copper torch invisible when placed (15.32.38).
7. "Lighting loading in weird" in caves (15.31.41): light grid filling in blotchy as you move.
8. Phantom chunks in the End (15.27.34: floating end-city pieces). mcopt own terrain.
9. End portal disappears when backing away (15.24.24): check after the vanilla surface change.
10. Distant Nether lava sea looks flat pink (15.20.04): Nether haze over lava.
11. Overall "bland and dead" in the overworld: grading/contrast pass needed, compared side by side with Reimagined.
12. FPS: 70-115 typical, ~43 over water. Next: per-feature specialization of the terrain shader, cheaper water path.
